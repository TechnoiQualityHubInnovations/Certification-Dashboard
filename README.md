# Introduction: 

Organizations strive to achieve ISO standard certifications as it guarantees that their products and services meet the highest quality standards. To help lead auditors of a certification board, effectively track, and manage their certifications, a comprehensive ISO certification dashboard has been designed using Power BI with the support of Dataverse. This dashboard provides a single, centralized location for tracking the audits and delivery of ISO certifications to clients, simplifying the entire process.

# Why our Dashboard ?

  - Certification providers can easily track the number of certifications delivered every month, as well as the number of completed and upcoming auditing processes.
  - The dashboard also provides information on the number of new and surveillance certifications, allowing providers to monitor the status of each certification and take      appropriate action as needed.
  - It helps us track the number of certifications which are going to expire within 60 days.
